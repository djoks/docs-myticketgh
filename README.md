\
The API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational\_State\_Transfer) and has predictable resource-oriented URLs that accept [form-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST\_\(HTTP\)#Use\_for\_submitting\_web\_forms) request bodies, return [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.\
\
While some API endpoints are open and unrestricted, others are protected and can only be accessed by passing a valid [JWT token](https://jwt.io/introduction) as a [bearer token](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/).\
